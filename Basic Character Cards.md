Character cards define your character.
The basic character card is always custom.
It has the name and appearance of your character.
It also states their LVL and max HP.

The XP character cards define how your character gains XP.
The 3 basic ones are:

| Type | Name | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Character | Learner | Gain 1 XP when you roll a dice less than average. |
| Character | Looter | You can trade 10 GP for 1 XP. |
| Character | Monster | Gain 1 XP for each LVL of each character you kill. |
