Cards can have a number of different parts.

The normal card is played and then discarded at the end of the turn.

A passive card, signified with 'P: ' is not discarded until its effects end.

A trap card, signified with 'Trap: ' is not discarded until it triggers.

If a card is not a Passive card or a Trap card, all waiting effects end at the end of the player's turn.

Resource cost, signified with '(N)' - with N being the amount, uses N Resource to be played.
