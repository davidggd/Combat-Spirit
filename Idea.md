Combat spirit is a card game inspired by DND and RPGs.
It combines cards and dice to make extremely customizable characters.
Each part of a character is described using cards.

Example character cards:

| Type | Name | Description |  |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Character | Sniper Joe | LVL 1, 10 HP |  |
| Character | Learner | Gain 1 XP when you roll a dice less than average. |  |
| Attack | Bow | Deal 1d8 Piercing. |  |
| Skill | Catch the wind | (1) The next dice roll is maxed out! |  |
| History | Human Ambition | You require (LVL) less XP to level up. |  |

Characters level up when they gain XP equal to 10 multiplied by their current level.

Character RANK is determined by (LVL // 5) + 1.

Characters have 1 + RANK * 2 cards in their hand.

Characters can play 1 + RANK cards each turn.

Each time a character levels up, they get 2 new cards.

The cards can be Attack, Skill, or History cards.

Characters have 2 + (LVL // 2) RESOURCE.

Characters have max RESOURCE at the start of a combat.

Cards that have "(N)" require N RESOURCE to use or play.

Cards have RANK as well.

Characters can only use cards with RANK less than or equal to their RANK.

To start combat, each character rolls a d20 to determine INITIATIVE.
If two characters roll the same number, the younger player goes first.
Every player draws their max amount of cards into their hand.
During a turn, a player plays their cards.
After playing their cards, the player places their used cards on the bottom of their deck and draws cards until their hand is full again.
Trap cards are not discarded until the trap has been sprung.
